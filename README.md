## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Change scrcpy Options

Edit the script's `cmd` line (around line 18) to customize scrcpy behavior:

```autohotkey
cmd := scrcpyPath . " --no-playback --keyboard=sdk --mouse=uhid"
```

Useful options:
- `--max-size=1920` - Limit screen resolution
- `--bit-rate=8M` - Adjust video quality
- `--stay-awake` - Keep screen on while connected

See [scrcpy documentation](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) for all options.

### Run on Windows Startup

1. Press `Win+R` and type `shell:startup`
2. Create a shortcut to `TabletControl.ahk` in that folder
3. Script will auto-launch when Windows starts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"scrcpy not found" error:**
- Check that scrcpy.exe is at the path specified in the script (line 4)
- Make sure you extracted scrcpy completely, not just the exe

**Tablet not detected:**
- Make sure USB debugging is enabled
- Try a different USB cable or port
- Run `adb devices` in Command Prompt to verify connection

**Keyboard typing doesn't work:**
- This is a known limitation with scrcpy's SDK mode
- Copy/paste will still work perfectly
- For full keyboard support, you'd need to use `--keyboard=uhid` but it may be choppy

**Mouse is laggy:**
- Try a USB 3.0 port instead of 2.0
- Reduce scrcpy quality with `--max-size=1280 --bit-rate=4M`
- Disable power saving for USB in tablet's Developer Options

**Script won't start:**
- Make sure you have AutoHotkey **v2.0+** (not v1.1)
- Right-click the script ‚Üí "Run Script"
